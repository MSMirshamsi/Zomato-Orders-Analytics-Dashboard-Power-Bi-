📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow using real-world Zomato orders data from 2017 to 2020.
The dashboard provides actionable insights into:

User behavior and customer acquisition/retention trends

Restaurant performance metrics

Cuisine preferences and demand patterns

Pricing analysis and revenue distribution

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop – for modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design

Power Query (M Language) – for data cleaning, transformation, and ETL processes

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for creating advanced calculations and business metrics

🔄 BI Development Process
1. Data Collection & Preparation

Imported raw Zomato order datasets (2017–2020) including orders, restaurants, users, and food categories.

Consolidated multiple Excel/CSV files using Power Query Folder Import.

Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

Applied Unpivot, Merge, and Append techniques to restructure data.

2. Data Modeling

Built a star schema data model with fact and dimension tables.

Created Calendar Table with calculated columns for Year, Quarter, Month, Week, Day, etc.

Defined relationships between orders, users, restaurants, and food items.

3. Data Analysis (DAX)

Developed professional measures such as:

Total Sales & Average Order Value

Customer Acquisition & Churn (Year-over-Year)

Average Distinct Restaurants per User

Monthly & Yearly Trends with Time Intelligence

Category-wise Revenue Contribution

4. Dashboard Design

Designed interactive dashboards with slicers, drill-through, and bookmarks.

Used professional report layout techniques: custom backgrounds, button navigation, and KPI cards.

Ensured responsiveness and optimized visuals for performance.

📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard

Identification of top-performing restaurants and their cuisine mix.

Customer retention trends: new vs. lost customers across years.

Seasonal demand patterns (monthly and quarterly fluctuations).

Menu pricing analysis to detect anomalies and standardization gaps.
