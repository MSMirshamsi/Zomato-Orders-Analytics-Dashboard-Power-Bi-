# Business Intelligence Project – Sales Dashboard  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates my skills in **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Data Analytics** by building a professional and interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
The dashboard analyzes sales performance across different years, customers, and products, providing actionable insights for decision-makers.  

The goal of this project is not only to show technical implementation (data modeling, DAX, visualization) but also to prove my ability to transform raw business data into **clear insights and KPIs** that directly support management decisions.

   - Created relationships to enable efficient analysis  

2. **ETL & Data Cleaning**  
   - Used Power Query to clean and transform raw sales data  
   - Applied merging, appending, and calculated columns  

3. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
   - Built measures for Yearly Sales, Previous Year Sales, and Growth %  
   - Created calculated tables for advanced analysis  

4. **Visualization & Storytelling**
